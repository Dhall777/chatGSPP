## Introduction

Welcome to **ChatGSPP**! This project is built on top of [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/your-repo/privategpt), a production-ready AI solution that enables you to ask questions about your documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), even without an Internet connection. With 100% privacy, no data leaves your execution environment at any point.

## Project Summary

**ChatGSPP** extends the capabilities of **PrivateGPT** into the world of website chatbots, conceptualizing it as an API that wraps a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and exposes its primitives.

### PrivateGPT Key Features

- **High-level API:**
  - **Ingestion of Documents:** Manages document parsing, splitting, metadata extraction, embedding generation, and storage internally.
  - **Chat & Completions:** Utilizes context from ingested documents, abstracting context retrieval, prompt engineering, and response generation.

- **Low-level API:**
  - **Embeddings Generation:** Generates embeddings based on text inputs.
  - **Contextual Chunks Retrieval:** Retrieves the most relevant chunks of text from ingested documents based on queries.

In addition to the API, **PrivateGPT** includes a working [Gradio UI](https://www.gradio.app/) client for testing the API, along with tools such as bulk model download scripts, ingestion scripts, and a documents folder watch feature.
