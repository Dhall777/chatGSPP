PrivateGPT provides an **API** containing all the building blocks required to
build **private, context-aware AI applications**.

<Callout intent = "tip">
If you are looking for an **enterprise-ready, fully private AI workspace**
check out [Zylon's website](https://zylon.ai)  or [request a demo](https://cal.com/zylon/demo?source=pgpt-docs).
Crafted by the team behind PrivateGPT, Zylon is a best-in-class AI collaborative
workspace that can be easily deployed on-premise (data center, bare metal...) or in your private cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure...).
</Callout>

The API follows and extends OpenAI API standard, and supports both normal and streaming responses.
That means that, if you can use OpenAI API in one of your tools, you can use your own PrivateGPT API instead,
with no code changes, **and for free** if you are running PrivateGPT in a `local` setup.

Get started by understanding the [Main Concepts and Installation](/installation) and then dive into the [API Reference](/api-reference).
