The Summarize Recipe provides a method to extract concise summaries from ingested documents or texts using PrivateGPT.
This tool is particularly useful for quickly understanding large volumes of information by distilling key points and main ideas.

## Use Case

The primary use case for the `Summarize` tool is to automate the summarization of lengthy documents,
making it easier for users to grasp the essential information without reading through entire texts.
This can be applied in various scenarios, such as summarizing research papers, news articles, or business reports.

## Key Features

1. **Ingestion-compatible**: The user provides the text to be summarized. The text can be directly inputted or retrieved from ingested documents within the system.
2. **Customization**: The summary generation can be influenced by providing specific `instructions` or a `prompt`. These inputs guide the model on how to frame the summary, allowing for customization according to user needs.
3. **Streaming Support**: The tool supports streaming, allowing for real-time summary generation, which can be particularly useful for handling large texts or providing immediate feedback.
